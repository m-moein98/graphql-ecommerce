# Ecommerce Project

this application was built to handle problems with saving and managing an ecommerce app using an GraphQl
the application is palnned to include E2E testing in frontend and unit testing in backend
the dockerfile, postman documentation and nginx conf are to be added in future

# Technical Choices

the reason behind choosing GraphQL over REST was to let frontend handle API and data flow to get the best preformance out of the app speed and development speed and since the app meant to join under a microservice architecture both mongoDB and Nestjs were fast-to-develop and scalable enough for the situation

# Trade-off

this project was built without any relation to user system due to being used under microservice architecture and some parts of the app are currently under develop
